Question 1
Which of the following are valid strategies for recovery after encountering service failure? (Select all that apply.)

1 / 1 point

Switching to a secondary instance.

Correct
Awesome! A quick way to recover is to have a secondary instance of the VM running your service that you can quickly switch to.


Setting up monitoring and alerts.


Restoring from backup.

Correct
Nice job! As long as you've been keeping frequent backups, restoring a previous VM image will often get you where you need to be.


Performing a rollback to a previous version.

Correct
Woohoo! If the problem is related to recent changes or updates, rolling back to a previous working version of the service or supporting software will give the time to investigate further.

Question 2
Which of the following concepts provide redundancy? (Select all that apply.)

1 / 1 point

Having a secondary instance of a VM.

Correct
Right on! If your primary VM instance running your service fails, having a secondary instance running in the background ready to take over can provide instant failover.


Having a secondary Cloud vendor.

Correct
You nailed it! Having a secondary Cloud service provider on hand with your data in case of the first provider having large-scale outages can provide redundancy for a worst-case scenario.


Having automatic backups configured.


Performing a rollback.

3.
Question 3
If you operate a service that stores any kind of data, what are some critical steps to ensure disaster recovery? (Select all that apply)

1 / 1 point

Implement automated backups

Correct
Nice work! As long as we have viable backup images, we can restore the VM running our service.


Use redundant systems wherever possible


Test backups by restoring

Correct
Excellent! It's important to know that our backup process is working correctly. It would not do to be in a recovery situation and not have backups.


Never delete old backups

Question 4
What is the correct term for packaged applications that are shipped with all needed libraries and dependencies, and allows the application to run in isolation?

1 / 1 point

Rollback


Secondary instance


Containers


Disk Image

Correct
Great job! Containerization ensures that our software runs the same way every time.

5.
Question 5
Using a large variety of containerized applications can get complicated and messy. What are some important tips for solving problems when using containers? (Select all that apply)

1 / 1 point

Use extensive logging in all parts

Correct
Great work! As long as we have the right logs in the right places, we can tell where our problems are.


Reduce the number of containers


Reuse container configurations


Use test instances

Correct
Nice job! We should take every opportunity to test and retest that our configuration is working properly.

Review module documentation! You are going to need to use these modules to complete the final project. Reading the documentation takes time, but as you become more familiar with the APIs provided by these modules, it could save you from writing a bunch of custom code that could have just been a call to a module function! Remember, we’ve covered these modules in previous lessons too, so feel free to go back and review them if you need a refresher!
